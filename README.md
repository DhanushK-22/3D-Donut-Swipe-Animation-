# 3D Donut Swipe Animation Prototype

This project demonstrates a **3D Donut Swipe Animation** prototype created in **Figma**. The prototype simulates rotating a 3D donut by swiping left or right, with each swipe changing the donut's angle in a smooth, animated way. This prototype uses **Figma's Auto Animate** and **Prototype** features to create an interactive 3D-like experience.

## Features
- **Swipe Interaction**: Users can swipe left or right to rotate the 3D donut.
- **Smooth Rotation**: The donut rotates smoothly between different angles to simulate 3D movement.
- **Interactive Prototype**: Users can interact with the donut to change its angle.
- **Mobile/Desktop Compatibility**: Works on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Auto-Animation**: Uses Figma's **Auto Animate** feature to smoothly transition between frames.

## Requirements
- Figma account (Free or Paid version).
- Basic knowledge of Figmaâ€™s interface and prototyping tools.


### Test the Animation
- Enter **Prototype Mode** and click **Present** to test the swipe interactions.
- Swipe left or right and observe the donut rotating smoothly through its frames.
